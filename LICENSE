-------

Many files were released as Gadget-2 in GPL. GPL permits re-licensing them in GPLv3.

Other files without license issues are released in GPLv3.

The file with a potential license issue is sfr_eff.c which originated from files in P-Gadget.
The algorithms are 13+ years old and it is unclear if the original authors are
still interested in keeping them private.
