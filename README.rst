=========

Massively Parallel Cosmological SPH Simulation Software - MP-Gadget forked from Simeon Bird

In this modified version of Gadget, we incorporate streaming velocity and compton heating. The objective of this project is to add streaming velocity while the baryons are still somewhat homogenous and before they settle into dark matter potential wells. We want to understand which halo masses are affected by the steaming velocity and potential coupling of streaming to shock heating.
